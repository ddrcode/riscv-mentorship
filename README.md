# RISC-V Software Mentorship 

This repository will serve as the base for the RISC-V International Mentorship Program (2025), focused on software development for the RISC-V platform.

## Scope

The mentorship will guide engineers through the foundations of RISC-V privilege models, system-level programming, 
and embedded/performance specializations using C, Assembly, and (optionally) Rust.
